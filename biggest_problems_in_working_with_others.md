# Biggest problems in working with others

I would say Communication. Communication is very important in a teamwork!

A good communication saves lots of time!

Last sememster, we have a final group project in network course. We all think it not hard so we simply have a discussion and split the work.

Then we start to do it. We think everything is going well. But before the day of the deadline, when we want to merge different parts together, we found that there's a misunderstanding in a concept. 

we have to drop our previous plan and start to do it in a different way!

After that, I learned that think through every problem we might meet and communicate with other settle down a final plan.
