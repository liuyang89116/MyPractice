# Sec 2: OOP Concepts

###13) What is difference between object oriented programming language and object based programming language?
Object based programming languages follow all the features of OOPs **except Inheritance**. Examples of object based programming languages are **JavaScript**, VBScript etc.

###14) What will be the initial value of an object reference which is defined as an instance variable?
The object references are all initialized to null in Java.

###15) What is constructor?
Constructor is just like a method that is used to initialize the state of an object. It is invoked at the time of object creation.

###16) What is the purpose of default constructor?
The default constructor provides the default values to the objects. The java compiler creates a default constructor only if there is no constructor in the class.

###17) Does constructor return any value?
**yes**, that is current instance (You cannot use return type yet it returns a value).

###18)Is constructor inherited?
**No**, constructor is not inherited.

###19) Can you make a constructor final?
**No**, constructor can't be final.


###20) What is static variable?
* static variable is used to refer the common property of all objects (that is not unique for each object) e.g. company name of employees,college name of students etc.
* static variable gets memory only once in class area at the time of class loading.
