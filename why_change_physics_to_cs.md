# Why change Physics to CS

Well, that's a interesting questions.

Actually, I love physics. I was admitted as a Ph.D student in XXX. You know the magnetism is because of the spin of the electrons. My research is to control the spin of the electrons so that at some condition, the stuff is magnetic, at some condition it is not. Which is called spin crossover.

However, it is really far from our life. It is now only happened in the lab. To make it to be used in our life, it may be 50 years later. 

I really want to make something that can change our life. I mean soon...not 50 years later...So I choose the Computer Science.

I was programming when I was in juior high, I used QBASIC. 

On the other hand, years of studying physics gives me solid math background. And make me solve problems rigorously.
